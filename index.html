<p id="one"> I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks! Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>
<h2>Why everyone should learn to code</h2>
<ul>
 <li> HTML is cool </li>
 <li>CSS is cooler </li>
 <li> JS is the best  </li>
<p>What do you need to create a website? Not much!</p>
<ol>
 <li>A computer (always a good start)</li>
 <li>A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
 <li>A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
 <li> Some HTML, CSS and JS files </li>
</ol>
<p> Follow my progress on github </p>
